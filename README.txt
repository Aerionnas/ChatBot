Project Title: ChatBot

Description: This is a chatbot program that I created my COSI 11a class. My
persona is based on my posse mentor. I chose this because I usually come to my
posse mentor for different reasons. We talk about academics, social life, my posse,
etc. Even though this is a silly program with silly responses, this is simulates 
the one on one meetings with a posse mentor.

Languages used: Java(Object Oriented Programming)

For this project, It requires for the ChatBotV3.java file in the chat folder to
be compiled and ran. There a lot of moving pieces in this program. It contains
several arrays for different type of responses that are randomly generated by the
chatbot. Each topic has several key words that trigger the chatbot to respond
using one of the responses fit the theme of the conversation. Essentially, the
idea is that when the user uses a keyword, it helps the chatbot to generate a
response.

This program is very simple, so I would like to make this program more challenging
in the future by making the responses more complicated. I would want the conversation
to flow more. While the responses are silly, I still believe that this program
itself it rather complicated. shows a

Credits: Some of the files the files in Lib were created by my professor, Timothy
Hickey at Brandeis University.

My code is the package, chat. To run this project, compile the ChatBotV3.java file
and run it in the terminal.
